# snake-game
This repository contains the code for implementing the classic Snake game using Turtle in Python. 
The game is played on a turtle GUI and the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food.
The game is over if the snake collides with a wall or with its own body.
The code includes all necessary components such as game logic, user input, and graphics. 
Feel free to download and use the code for your own projects or to contribute to the repository.
